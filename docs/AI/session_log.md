### Request: Change lockdb and bucket names to prefix with "dae-"
**User Query:** "lets change the name of the lockdb and bucket to prefix with a dae-"

**Response:** Updated the terraform.tfvars file in `voters/infra/aws/tf-state/` to change:
- `lockdb_name` from "paulcarlton-voters-tfstate-lock" to "dae-voters-tfstate-lock"
- `bucket_name` from "paulcarlton-voters-tfstate" to "dae-voters-tfstate"

The names now use the "dae-" prefix as requested, which will affect the DynamoDB table for Terraform state locking and the S3 bucket for storing Terraform state files.

### Follow-up Request: Update backend.tf files to reflect new bucket name
**User Query:** "This change of bucket name needs to be reflected in the backend.tf files under infra/aws"

**Response:** Updated all three backend.tf files under infra/aws to use the new bucket name:
- `voters/infra/aws/vpc/backend.tf` - Changed bucket from "paulcarlton-voters-tfstate" to "dae-voters-tfstate"
- `voters/infra/aws/db/backend.tf` - Changed bucket from "paulcarlton-voters-tfstate" to "dae-voters-tfstate"
- `voters/infra/aws/eks/backend.tf` - Changed bucket from "paulcarlton-voters-tfstate" to "dae-voters-tfstate"

All backend.tf files now consistently use the new bucket name that matches the terraform.tfvars configuration.
